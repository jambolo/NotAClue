value is an object containing a a `player` element describing the player making the suggestion, a `cards` array decribing the cards in
the suggestion, and a `showed` array describing the actions of the other players. For example,
```javascript

```
##### Master Detective Rules
If Master Detective rules are being used, then any player that has a suggested card must show it. All players that show a card are
listed.
##### Classic Rules
If Classic rules are used, then only one card is shown. The players that did or did not have a card are listed, but the last player
is the player that showed a card.
#### show
One or more **show** events may occur after a **suggest** event if any cards are shown to you. The event value is an object containing
a `player` element describing the player that showed the card and a `card` element describing the card that was shown. For example,
```javascript
{ "show" : { "player" : "chris" , "card" : "billiard" } }
{ "show" : { "player" : "liz", "card" : "mustard" } }
```
